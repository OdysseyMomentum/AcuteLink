> The right care, at the right place and at the right time.

Every year, about 1 million patients go to / are referred to a Hospital Emergency Department unnecessarily, putting an enormous pressure on these departments’ scarce capacity. At the same time, research has shown that most of these patients would have had better long-term clinical outcomes if they had been treated in a more appropriate care setting (e.g. ELV or Home Care).

Our Virtual Care Coordination (VCC) platform facilitates an efficient communication and collaboration between all acute care stakeholders, enabling patients to receive the right care, at the right place and at the right time.
